            <h2>What & Why Is Dark Consent?</h2>

            <p><span><b><i>Dark Consent</i></b></span> is a phrase we have coined to describe the pattern of coercion, manipulation and antagonism of modern companies in relation to their users.</p>

            <p>The world is becoming ever more polarised and human rights, consumer rights and privacy are under attack from all angles.</p>

            <p>Technology was once seen as something created for us but now more and more it is being used against us.</p>
